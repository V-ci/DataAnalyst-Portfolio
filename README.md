**Seattle AirBnb Data**

- Dataset from Kaggle: URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?select=reviews.csv
- Visualization focused on questions like:
  - Where to find a good AirBnb in Seattle in terms of price and location? 
  - If an AirBnb is lived in as well, when is the best time to put the house on the market for AirBnb?
  -  Does the amount of bedroom affect the price of the listing? or What is the best amount of bedrooms to invest in to put up for AirBnb?
  -  What does the competition (by # of bedrooms) looks like? What is the most listed or what is in demand?
