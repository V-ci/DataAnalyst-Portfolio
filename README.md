**Seattle AirBnb Data**
- Dataset from Kaggle: URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?select=reviews.csv
- Visualization focused on questions like:
  i) Where to find a good AirBnb in Seattle in terms of price and location? 
  ii) If an AirBnb is lived in as well, when is the best time to put the house on the market for AirBnb?
  iii) Does the amount of bedroom affect the price of the listing? or What is the best amount of bedrooms to invest in to put up for AirBnb?
  iv) What does the competition (by # of bedrooms) looks like? What is the most listed or what is in demand?
