  - If an AirBnb is lived in as well, when is the best time to put the house on the market for AirBnb?
  -  Does the amount of bedroom affect the price of the listing? or What is the best amount of bedrooms to invest in to put up for AirBnb?
  -  What does the competition (by # of bedrooms) looks like? What is the most listed or what is in demand?
